This note is to specify an approximate model of VSD absorption and re-emission and the variation of those properties with membrane potential. In the absence of exact data, I'll use a stylized form such as the example shown below.

There is a slight skew in the example, as would be expected if the frequency spectrum, i.e., flourescence as a function of frequency rather than a function of wavelength, were Gaussian. A Gaussian frequency spectrum is what I'll assume for both emission and absorption.

The example's red curve can be approximated by using a Gaussian mean corresponding to the peak wavelength of 675 nm, i.e., a frequency of $\frac{300}{675}\:PHz$, and supposing that an edge of the spectrum, roughly 525 nm, corresponds to 3 standard deviations in frequency, i.e.,$$sd = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{300}{525}-\frac{300}{675}\right).$$(The curve is given as a probability density function.)

```{r fig.align='center', fig.show='hold', fig.width=5}
fmean <- 300/675
fsd <- (300/525 - fmean)/3
# Changing the variable from frequency to wavelength introduces the factor of 300/lambda^2
spec <- function(lambda)dnorm(300/lambda, fmean, fsd)*300/lambda^2
lambda <- seq(500, 900, length.out = 100)
plot(lambda, spec(lambda), type='l', col="red", lwd=3, xlab="wavelength (nm)", ylab="", main = "Stylized VSD emission spectrum")
```

Peak emission and absorption wavelengths for various lipid-bound chromophores are given in Leslie Loew's review, [Design and Use of Organic Voltage Sensitive Dyes](http://www.newbooks-services.de/MediaFiles/Texts/8/9781441965578_Excerpt_001.pdf) (ungated pdf). Spectrum widths are not indicated in the review but widths of several hundred nanometers seem typical elsewhere in the literature.

As indicated in the example, spectral shifts due to changes in membrane potential must also be modeled.
