This note is to specify an approximate model of VSD absorption and re-emission and the variation of those properties with membrane potential. In the absence of exact data, I'll use a stylized form such as the example shown below.

There is a slight skew in the example, as would be expected if the frequency spectrum, i.e., flourescence as a function of frequency rather than a function of wavelength, were Gaussian. A Gaussian frequency spectrum is what I'll assume for both emission and absorption.

The example's red curve can be approximated by using a Gaussian mean corresponding to the peak wavelength of 675 nm, i.e., a frequency of $\frac{300}{675}\:PHz$, and supposing that an edge of the spectrum, roughly 525 nm, corresponds to 3 standard deviations in frequency, i.e.,$$sd = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{300}{525}-\frac{300}{675}\right).$$ 

```{r fig.align='center', fig.show='hold', fig.width=5}
fmean <- 300/675
fsd <- (300/525 - fmean)/3
freq <- seq(300/500, 300/900, length.out = 100)
spec <- dnorm(freq, fmean, fsd)
plot(300/freq, spec, type='l', col="red", lwd=3, xlab="wavelength (nm)", ylab="", main = "Stylized VSD emission spectrum")
```
