This is a draft, to be revised upon review by the Photoacoustic Neuroimaging subproject.

The photoacoustic neuroimaging subproject has recently measured the photoacoustic response of various pH sensitive dyes. Their experimental setup is diagrammed below. A preamplifier extension to the hydrophone is not shown. The labeled distances are my estimates based on their text and hydrophone specs. They are approximate.

Response is presented in terms of millivolts per millijoule. I provisionally assume millivolts to refer to preamp output and millijoules to refer to the laser source. For use in simulations, I would like to convert these figures to excitation and response at the dye well.

Since the laser beam directly impacts the well through an essentially transparent path (whether air or gel,) I'll assume full power of the beam arrives at the gel. Approximating the well as a hemisphere of 3mm, its volume would be $\frac{2}{3}\pi 3^3 = 56.5\:mm^3$. Assuming the well is full of dye solution, this corresponds to an energy density of $$\frac{1}{56.5} = 0.0177\:mJ/mm^3 = 17.7\:\mu J/mm^3 = 17.7\:kPa.$$

Preamp specs indicate a broadband gain of 20 dB, a factor of 10 in amplitude. Thus, voltage at the hydrophone will be on the order of 10% of that at preamp output. Hydrophone sensitivity (depending on the exact model) is either $8\:nV/Pa$ or $45\:nV/Pa.$ I'll use $10\:nV/Pa$ as an order of magnitude. Thus a millivolt, or $10^6\:nV$ at preamp output corresponds to $\approx 10^5\:nV$ at the hydrophone output, or $10^4\:Pa$ at the hydrophone input.

Energy density will suffer an $r^2$ loss between the surface of the well and the hydrophone input 10mm away. Its magnitude will be roughly $\left(\frac{3}{3+10}\right)^2 = 0.053.$ Thus $10^4\:Pa$ at the hydrophone input corresponds to $\frac{10^4}{0.053} = 188679.2 \approx 189 \:kPa$ at the well.

In sum:

* A millivolt at preamp output corresponds to $\approx 189\:kPa$ at the well.
* A millijoule of laser input corresponds to $\approx 17.7\:\mu J/mm^3 = 17.7\:kPa$ of energy density at the well.
* To convert from $mV/mJ$ in the report to $kPa/(\mu J/mm^3)$ at the well, multiply the former by $\frac{189}{17.7} = 10.68 \approx 10.$
