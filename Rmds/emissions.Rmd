A mole is $6.022\times 10^{23}$ (Avagadro's number) of molecules per liter. VSD and cypridina luciferase concentrations in tissue might be on the order of 1 micromole, or $6.022 \times 10^{17}$  molecules per liter. Since spatial resolutions on the order of millimeters are contemplated, cubic mm are an appropriate unit. Since a cubic mm is $10^{-6}$ liters, a micromole concentration corresponds to $6.022 \times 10^{11}$ molecules per cubic mm.

Since msec time resolutions are contemplated, and since existing VSDs have half-lives in the msec range, assuming 1 msec half-lives for VSDs is a reasonable heuristic.   

The light emitting protein, cypridina luciferase, has a half-life on the order of [1 hour](http://www.piercenet.com/product/pierce-cypridina-luciferase-glow-assay-kit) which implies chemical conversion, hence photon emission, per millisecond equal to a fraction, $1-(1/2)^{\frac{1}{60 \times 60 \times 1000}} \approx 2 \times 10^7$, of available molecules. At a micromole concentration, this implies $2 \times 10^{-7} \times 6.022 \times 10^{11} \approx 116000$ cypridina luciferase emissions per millisecond, per cubic mm.

Assuming the rate of cypridina luciferase emission is essentially constant over time scales of interest, let $v$ be the number of VSD molecules per cubic mm which are excited and which eventually emit a NIR photon rather than relaxing through vibration. Then $v$ satisfies$$\frac{dv}{dt}=116000\times \epsilon - \frac{1}{2}v$$where $\epsilon$ is the efficiency at which cypridina luciferase emissions excite NIR-emitting VSD molecules. A value for $\epsilon$ can only be guessed at this point.

At steady state, $\frac{dv}{dt}=0.$ Hence, at steady state, $\frac{1}{2}v = 116000 \times \epsilon$, and $v = 2 \times 116000 \times \epsilon.$ Since half of these relax via NIR emission per msec, the rate of NIR photon emission is $116000 \times \epsilon$ per cubic mm, per millisecond.
